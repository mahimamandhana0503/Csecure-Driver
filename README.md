# C-secure
Csecure is a child tracking system. 
The project is based on **child safety and tracking**, whenever a child on boards and off boards the school bus.
The major problem with small kids are they sometimes get into wrong bus and sometimes the bus driver forgets them in the school. The school also cannot keep the track of bus and student this creates a lot of tension both on parents and the school side. So for these problems we came with a solution of CSECURE. Csecure tracks the presence of child in bus and based on the presence it notifies the school(admin), parents and the bus driver.

Technology used are:
* Android
* Firebase
* Raspberrypi
* Python 
* RFid Sensors


## People who are concerned about children security:

1.**Parents:**

The major concern of parents now a days is that when their children will leave the school campus and when they will reach to their home. Parents of big cities are working class so they may not be available everytime. So, they have no idea and when and where their children are boarding the bus and off boarding the bus.

2.**School:**

Similary the school also want the status of all buses and their current location. The school also want the count of student present in the bus. The speed of the bus. The driver details i.e phone number, name etc. A system which could track the bus in realtime. Beside these schools also want an interface through which school can directly contact with the parent of respective child.

3.**Bus-Driver:**

The bus-drivers' concerns are the children count in bus. Which child has boarded the bus in morning which hasn't. There's a lot of confusion with whether driver should wait for a child to board a bus or not. There are unnecessary waiting time.
The new drivers doesnot even know the stop of children. So sometimes they skip a stop.

## SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS:

**CSECURE:**

for the above problems we came up with three APPs(android) and One Raspberry-pi interface.
* [The Admin APP](https://github.com/mahimamandhana0503/C-secure/tree/master/Admin): 
* The Parents' APP:
* The BusDrivers' APP(https://github.com/mahimamandhana0503/Csecure-Driver):
* [Raspberry pi interface](https://github.com/mahimamandhana0503/C-secure/blob/master/spifile.py)


This git consist of the admin application and raspberry pi interfacing

The raspberry pi is connected with 3 RFID sensors and the rfid tags are placed inside the shoe of the child. So as soon as child enters the bus the presence is marked by the raspberry pi and the trigger is sent by the raspi to the firebase a realtime database. This database notifies the bus driver, parent and school that child has boarded the bus.
